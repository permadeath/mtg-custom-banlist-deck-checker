# mtg-custom-banlist-deck-checker
A simple Python program to check MtG decks against a custom banlist

How to use:

```
1. Edit banlist.txt with the cards on your custom banlist.
   Each line should be 1 card namewith nothing else.
2. Export your deck from whatever deckbuilding site you use as a simple .txt file
3. Run the program, click the button, and select the text file of your deck
```

Just keep in mind when exporting your deck to use the simple .txt export.  It should just have the amount, a space, and the card name.  Ex:

```
1 Cavern of Souls
1 Magus of the Moon
9 Nazgul
60 Mountain
```

Some other ways of exporting add set information or other irrelevant things that will cause a match to not be found.
